# PasswordVerifyPython
This code was created by Quoxy.
The code consists of entering a password twice!
and if the 2nd password is the same as the first, then his account will be created!
I am French, so I use google translate so the translation can be bad.
In addition, I am a beginner so my level is low but I am progressing and I am learning the "Java" language!
